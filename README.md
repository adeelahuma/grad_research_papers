This term paper analyzes the ethical consequences of using FriendlyScore API for social credit scoring as an alternate to traditional credit scoring (FICO score). FriendlyScore uses social media data (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram) to generate social score that is used by lenders to fund students. This project was done for PYTFund organization.
